            <td><b>Fake Currency Detection for Blind using Image Processing</b></td>
            <td>Fake currency detection for blind individuals using image processing involves the use of advanced technology to help visually impaired people identify counterfeit banknotes. This system employs a camera to capture an image of the currency, which is then processed by specialized software to analyze various features like watermarks, security threads, holograms, and serial numbers. By comparing these features with authentic banknote characteristics, the software can determine the authenticity of the currency. The results are then communicated to the user through audio feedback or vibrations, enabling the blind user to accurately identify counterfeit money independently.</td>

            <td><b>Drowsiness Detection for Drivers using Image Processing</b></td>
            <td>Drowsiness detection for drivers using image processing is a safety system designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. This technology uses a camera to continuously monitor the driver's face and eyes. Image processing algorithms analyze visual cues such as blink rate, eye closure duration, and head movements to detect signs of drowsiness. When the system identifies these indicators, it alerts the driver through audio warnings, vibrations, or visual signals, encouraging them to take a break or seek rest. This proactive approach helps reduce the risk of accidents, enhancing road safety.</td>
